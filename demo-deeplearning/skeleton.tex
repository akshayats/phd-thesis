\section{DNN problem formulations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bar code type of problem
\item fly on object type of problem - Who am I?
\item In painting
\item Include IFRC data as metadata
\end{itemize}
Why not deep learning explored? Model importance for interpretability. Data constraints. Data feeding constraints.
\section{Parallels to graph neural networks}
refer to work from Talukdar tutorial
\section{SORHACK Demo}
Possible to include this chapter \ref{chap:objEstimation}
\subsection{Problem statement}
\begin{itemize}
\item motivation
\item resources
\item hidden object estimation
\end{itemize}
success measurement. Precision Recall why not used? Refer papers - Sanne Elena
\section{Further challenges}problems with object identification with integration to vision system.
\section{TODO}
\begin{itemize}
\item Report? arXiv paper on system integration?
\item Make up the video
\end{itemize}
