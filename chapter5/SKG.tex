\section{Environment Recognition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why constrain to objects?
\item Generalise to all kinds of environments. Football scenes, Chess boards, Crime scenes
\item Key points - large network graphs
\item Use large networks to analyse
\item place in this context environment recognition in office places
\item elaborate on nodes, graph construction, edges what ARE nodes in interpretation.
\end{itemize}
\section{Kronecker graph theory}
\section{Related works for large network analysis}
\section{INSERT PAPER - FMM for SKG}
\section{Discussion on generative model}
What are the main takeaways from the generative model?
\section{TODO}
- convert couple scenes into large networks for examples
- run inference experiments
